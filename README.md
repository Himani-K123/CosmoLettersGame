Motivation:
Our motivation for building CosmoLetters was to create an exciting and educational word game that combines letter collection with word-building challenges. We aimed to develop a game that engages players of all ages, stimulates their vocabulary, and enhances their word-forming abilities in a fun and interactive way.

CosmoLetters addresses the challenge of enhancing vocabulary and word-building skills in a unique way. By combining the thrill of exploration with word formation tasks, the game encourages players to expand their lexicon, improve spelling, and practice strategic thinking. It provides an interactive solution for players to enhance their language abilities while having fun.

Key Features:
1 Letter Collection: Explore cosmic environments to collect letters scattered across the landscapes.
2 Word Formation: Utilize the collected letters to create words within a time limit.
3 Time Challenges: Race against the clock to form as many words as possible before time runs out.
